The third planet from the Sun in [[Locations/Realmspace\|Realmspace]]. The known history of Toril spans for thousands of years, extending back into the misty epochs after Ao sundered the world of Abeir-Toril after the Tearfall, splitting it into the two twin planets, Abeir and Toril. Toril consisted of various continents and islands, including [[Locations/Faerûn\|Faerûn]], Kara-Tur, and Zakhara in the central super-continent and, throughout most of its history Anchorome, Maztica, and Katashaka in the western region of the world. There was also one large and very mysterious continent east of Kara-Tur called Osse whose nature and inhabitants were all but unknown.
