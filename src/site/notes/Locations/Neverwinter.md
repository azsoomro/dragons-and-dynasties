Neverwinter, also known as the **City of Skilled Hands** and the **Jewel of the North**, was a bustling, cultured, and cosmopolitan city-state in northwest [[Locations/Faerûn\|Faerûn]]. Neverwinter is a friendly city of craftsmen, who trade extensively via the great merchants of [[Locations/Waterdeep\|Waterdeep]]; their water-clocks and multi-hued lamps can be found throughout the Realms. Neverwinter gained its name from the skill of its gardeners, who contrived to keep flowers blooming throughout the months of snow—a practice they continue with pride.
