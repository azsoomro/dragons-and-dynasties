The [[Locations/Neverwinter Academy\|Neverwinter Academy]] was a school for magic and combat in the district of the [[Locations/Beggar's Nest\|Beggar's Nest]] in the city of [[Locations/Neverwinter\|Neverwinter]] on the [[Locations/Sword Coast\|Sword Coast North]].

It was destroyed in an act of terrorism some years ago. It is learned that [[Characters/Luard Starwalker\|Luard Starwalker]] was a student at the academy, and many of his friends died at the hands of [[NPCs/Unidentified masked men with spider symbols\|masked men with spider symbols]].

Victims of the incident are interred at a nearby graveyard. An enclave bears the writing, "In the loving memory of the martyrs of [[Locations/Neverwinter Academy\|Neverwinter Academy]]."

Presently, the [[Locations/Grand Theater of Performing Arts\|Grand Theater of Performing Arts]] sits atop the ruins of the academy.
