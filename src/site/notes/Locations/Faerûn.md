A major continent on the planet of [[Locations/Toril\|Toril]].

The word "[[Locations/Faer没n\|Faer没n]]" was a modified version of "Faerie," the name of the homeland of ancient elves. The term was coined by Durothil, prince of Tintageer, Faerie. The continent included terrain that was as varied as any other. Besides the exterior coastline to the west and south, the most dominant feature on the continent was the Sea of Fallen Stars. This was an irregular inland sea that kept the interior lands fertile, connected the west and east regions of [[Locations/Faer没n\|Faer没n]] and served as a major trade route for many of the bordering nations.
