A region of wilderness, difficult winter weather, orc hordes, and barbarian tribes, this region was generally referred to as **The North**, which also contained most of the **Sword Coast North**. It was a mostly untamed region that lay between the large Anauroch desert in the east and the expansive Sea of Swords in the west, north of the High Moor.
