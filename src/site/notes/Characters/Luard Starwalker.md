The high-elf wizard, stands with an aura of ethereal elegance. His snow-white hair cascades like a waterfall of pure silk, framing a face marked by deep blue eyes that shimmer with the intensity of a stormy sea. His healthy white skin-tone glows with an almost otherworldly light, enhancing his serene yet formidable presence.

He is clad in impeccably tailored white pants, tucked into boots that weave together the rich hues of brown, gold, and blue. These boots, sturdy yet stylish, are perfect for both the rugged terrain of his journeys and the grand halls of magical academia. Atop his head sits a wizard's hat of gold-brown, its wide brim shadowing his intense gaze.

His shirt, an elegant blend of brown and gold, complements his robes, which are primarily brown adorned with elaborate golden designs. These intricate patterns glow faintly, hinting at the powerful enchantments woven into the fabric. Beneath the robes, a subtle blue glow emanates, suggesting the presence of potent magical energies waiting to be unleashed.

Every aspect of his attire speaks to his mastery of magic and his connection to the ancient traditions of the high-elves, blending practicality with an undeniable sense of style and authority.
