Against a dim blue landscape in the twilit hours of the evening stands a young priest before you, tall and proud. He is clad in heavy purple armor that gleams in moonlight filtering through the gossamer clouds above. His short, pointed ears, salt and pepper hair, and elven features convey a sense of wisdom and grace, while his slender build belies his true physical strength. Only his strong, square jaw lightly covered with a short and kempt auburn-colored beard hints at a unique lineage.

The amulet around his neck glows softly with lunar energy, symbolizing his devotion to [[NPCs/Selûne\|Selûne]]. In one hand, he grips a massive warhammer, its purple handle contrasting with the grey metallic head. His other hand steadies a deep black shield emblazoned with [[NPCs/Selûne\|Selûne]]'s symbol, both tools of protection and symbols of his faith. Behind him, the blurred outline of the temple of [[NPCs/Selûne\|Selûne]] hints at the sacred surroundings where he serves and draws his strength.

**Race:** Custom Lineage (half-dwarf half-elf)
**Class:** Cleric 1 (Twilight Domain)
