He strides through moonlit groves, battle-scarred and resolute. His face bears the map of countless skirmishes—scars intersecting like ancient runes. Azure eyes, once bright, now hold a milky hue. A white beard frames a mouth that rarely smiles.
 
His silver armor, woven from moonlight, shimmers with gold filigree. At his side, the magical longsword of goblin slaying emits a faint cerulean aura visible only to the initiated—a blade hungry for justice.
 
The spider symbol, inked in blood, binds him to vengeance. His old kith and kin fell victim to the arachnid menace in defense of Estadul, his home. Now, his new allies walk beside him, their camaraderie fragile yet resilient. His vow echoes: “I shall not fail again.”
