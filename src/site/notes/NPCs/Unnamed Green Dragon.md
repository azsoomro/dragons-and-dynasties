[[Characters/Bughuda “Huda” Qasai\|Huda]] confronted a seemingly human-looking male wizard performing a ritual in which [[NPCs/Bess\|Bess]] was to be sacrified.

Huda threw a severed head of a goblin at him. In shock and horror, the wizard recoiled, letting out an exclamation in Draconic--**"Asha'bellanar!"**--before turning into a green dragon, bursting through the roof and escaping into the night sky.
