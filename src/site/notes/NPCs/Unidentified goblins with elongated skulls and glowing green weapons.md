Strange goblins with elongated skulls and glowing green weapons.

They occasionally joined the [[Fellowships/Cragmaws\|Cragmaws]], but terrified them with their presence.

One of them had looked at [[NPCs/Sildar Hallwinter\|Sildar Hallwinter]] and exclaimed, "You are not what [[NPCs/Ruxithid\|Ruxithid]] wants."
