[[Characters/Bughuda “Huda” Qasai\|Huda]] confronted a seemingly human-looking male shaman performing a ritual in which [[NPCs/Bess\|Bess]] was to be sacrified in [[Locations/Delian's Tomb\|Delian's Tomb]].

[[Characters/Bughuda “Huda” Qasai\|Huda]] threw a goblin's severed head at him. In shock and horror, the shaman recoiled, letting out an exclamation in Draconic--**"Asha'bellanar!"**--before turning into a green dragon, bursting through the roof and escaping into the night sky.
