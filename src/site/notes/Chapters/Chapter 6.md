# The Lost Sister

After intense training with her brother Sten, Huda unearthed a hidden power within herself, a force she had never known. As she made her way to rejoin her friends, a chilling sensation crept over her—she was being followed. Turning swiftly, she confronted her pursuer, only to find Allura’s enigmatic maidservant, Mithxa, who revealed that her mistress urgently desired a meeting with the party.

Suspicion hung in the air as Huda escorted Mithxa to her companions. She explained the situation, and despite their unease, the group agreed to follow Mithxa to Allura’s tower. Upon arrival, they were suddenly thrust into a nightmarish illusion—a brutal, life-or-death battle against relentless constructs. They fought valiantly, their strength waning as they barely emerged victorious, battered and bloodied.

Believing they had been betrayed, the party confronted Mithxa with growing hostility, but just as tensions reached a breaking point, Allura herself appeared. Her presence commanded silence as she scolded Mithxa sharply for her recklessness, revealing that the test was not meant to be undertaken alone. With a graceful apology, Allura offered healing to the wounded adventurers and invited them to share in a calming tea.

As the tension eased, Allura revealed the dire situation involving Sister Garaele, explaining her perilous mission and requesting the party's protection on her next journey. Just then, the door burst open, and a furious woman stormed into the room, her eyes blazing with anger. Without warning, she struck Zyluxias across the face, leaving the room in stunned silence.

Demanding answers, Zyluxias confronted the woman, who revealed herself as Azvameth, his long-lost sister, hidden beneath an illusion spell and masquerading as Sister Garaele. Her voice trembled with emotion as she recounted her harrowing tale—how she had been gravely injured, how she assumed Sister Garaele's identity to protect the town, and how she was desperately searching for a powerful wizard’s spellbook. But something sinister was at work; every time she ventured to Conyberry, she returned injured and with her memory in tatters.

Determined to uncover the truth, the party vowed to aid Azvameth in her quest. As they discussed their next steps, Allura turned her attention to Huda, speaking in cryptic riddles about her newfound power. The words, shrouded in mystery, left Huda more perplexed than ever, the weight of destiny pressing heavily upon her shoulders.

The session ended with the group united in purpose, but the shadows of uncertainty and danger loomed larger than ever. The road ahead was fraught with peril, and the secrets they had uncovered were only the beginning.
