# A Dangerous Journey

Our adventurers—[[Characters/Bughuda “Huda” Qasai\|Huda]], [[Characters/Luard Starwalker\|Luard]], [[Characters/Moghul Khan\|Moghul]], [[Characters/Torebrul “Tor” Drakechest\|Tor]], and [[Characters/Zyluxias Relmaur\|Zyluxias]]—recently decided to name themselves "The [[Fellowships/Ember Knights\|Ember Knights]]" after their triumphant battles. As they gathered at the [[Locations/Driftwood Tavern\|Driftwood Tavern]], [[NPCs/Gundren Rockseeker\|Gundren Rockseeker]] found them, explaining a location mishap and advising them to rest. Promising crucial information the next morning, he left them with a sense of anticipation.

At dawn, the party assembled at a breakfast table where [[NPCs/Gundren Rockseeker\|Gundren]] greeted his old friends [[Characters/Bughuda “Huda” Qasai\|Huda]], [[Characters/Luard Starwalker\|Luard]], and [[Characters/Torebrul “Tor” Drakechest\|Tor]] warmly. He revealed a mission of utmost importance that required their skills and trust: guarding and delivering a wagon of provisions to the [[NPCs/Sovereign of Esson\|Sovereign of Esson]]. He offered 20 gold pieces each upon completion. When pressed for more details, [[NPCs/Gundren Rockseeker\|Gundren]] whispered about a [[Locations/Wave Echo Cave\|significant discovery]] in [[Locations/Esson\|Esson]], promising to share it with them upon arrival. If his suspicions were correct, it would bring them unimaginable wealth.

Agreeing to the task, [[NPCs/Gundren Rockseeker\|Gundren]] informed them the cart would be ready the next day. He introduced [[NPCs/Sildar Hallwinter\|Sildar Hallwinter]], a former knight and member of the [[Fellowships/Lord's Alliance\|Lord's Alliance]], who would accompany him on his journey. With a farewell, [[NPCs/Gundren Rockseeker\|Gundren]] and [[NPCs/Sildar Hallwinter\|Sildar]] departed, leaving the party to prepare for their adventure.

The [[Fellowships/Ember Knights\|Ember Knights]] decided to visit [[Locations/Ye Olde Mart of Wal\|Ye Olde Mart of Wal]] for provisions. Amidst bustling merchants, [[Characters/Zyluxias Relmaur\|Zyluxias]] met a [[NPCs/Rudgoph\|red dragonborn blacksmith]] who questioned him about his clan, to which [[Characters/Zyluxias Relmaur\|Zyluxias]] replied that he has none. Seeking solace, [[Characters/Luard Starwalker\|Luard]] visited the graves of his fallen comrades and teachers. The party accompanied him, and along the way, they passed a [[Locations/Grand Theater of Performing Arts\|performance theater]] built over his [[Locations/Neverwinter Academy\|old academy]]. After paying their respects, [[Characters/Luard Starwalker\|Luard]] revealed the tragic story of [[NPCs/Unidentified masked men with spider symbols\|masked men with spider symbols]] who attacked his academy, stole an artifact, and left destruction in their wake. [[Characters/Moghul Khan\|Moghul]], recognizing the symbol, shared that his friends had been similarly attacked, and vowed to help Luard find these [[NPCs/Unidentified masked men with spider symbols\|mysterious assailants]]. [[Characters/Torebrul “Tor” Drakechest\|Tor]] and [[Characters/Zyluxias Relmaur\|Zyluxias]] also pledged their support.

The next day, the cart arrived, and the party set off on their journey to [[Locations/Esson\|Esson]]. Traveling along the [[Locations/High Road\|High Road]], they reached the [[Locations/Triboar Trail\|Triboar Trail]] and discovered two dead horses blocking the path. Before they could investigate, goblins ambushed them. In the heat of battle, [[Characters/Leon Greyhawk\|Leon Greyhawk]], a priest from the [[Fellowships/Church of Tyr\|Church of Tyr]], appeared. Sent by [[NPCs/Gundren Rockseeker\|Gundren]] to ensure their safety, he joined the fray. After defeating the goblins, they realized the horses belonged to [[NPCs/Gundren Rockseeker\|Gundren]] and [[NPCs/Sildar Hallwinter\|Sildar]], who had left a day earlier. Following tracks, they arrived at [[Locations/Cragmaw Cave\|Cragmaw Cave]].

Inside, they navigated a series of interconnected caverns. In one cavern, they found [[NPCs/Yeemik\|Yeemik]], a goblin, holding a severely beaten [[NPCs/Sildar Hallwinter\|Sildar]] captive. The party launched a fierce attack, gaining the upper hand. Desperate, [[NPCs/Yeemik\|Yeemik]] offered a truce, but [[NPCs/Sildar Hallwinter\|Sildar]] warned them against trusting the goblin. Ignoring the plea, the party swiftly defeated the remaining goblins and captured [[NPCs/Yeemik\|Yeemik]].

Under interrogation, [[NPCs/Yeemik\|Yeemik]] revealed that [[NPCs/Klarg\|Klarg]], a bugbear, led the [[Fellowships/Cragmaws\|Cragmaws]] and reported to [[NPCs/King Grol\|King Grol]] of [[Locations/Cragmaw Castle\|Cragmaw Castle]]. Under the instruction of a mysterious figure who went by the name of the [[NPCs/Spider\|Spider]], [[NPCs/Gundren Rockseeker\|Gundren]] had been taken to [[NPCs/King Grol\|King Grol]], along with a map to [[Locations/Wave Echo Cave\|Wave Echo Cave]], a legendary mine rich in minerals and magical power. [[NPCs/Yeemik\|Yeemik]] mentioned strange [[NPCs/Unidentified goblins with elongated skulls and glowing green weapons\|goblins with elongated skulls and glowing green weapons]] who occasionally joined the [[Fellowships/Cragmaws\|Cragmaws]], terrifying them with their eerie presence.

After learning this, the party executed [[NPCs/Yeemik\|Yeemik]] and tended to [[NPCs/Sildar Hallwinter\|Sildar]]'s wounds. Upon regaining consciousness, [[NPCs/Sildar Hallwinter\|Sildar]] explained his mission with [[NPCs/Gundren Rockseeker\|Gundren]] to [[Locations/Esson\|Esson]] and his quest to find [[NPCs/Iarno Albrek\|Iarno Albrek]], a wizard and fellow member of the [[Fellowships/Lord's Alliance\|Lord's Alliance]] who had vanished. He shared the history of [[Locations/Wave Echo Cave\|Wave Echo Cave]] and the [[Story Elements/Essex Pact\|Essex Pact]], detailing the magical forge and the catastrophic bandit attack that buried its secrets. [[NPCs/Sildar Hallwinter\|Sildar]] believed [[NPCs/Gundren Rockseeker\|Gundren]]'s map showed the [[Locations/Wave Echo Cave\|cave]]'s location and that it had been sent to [[NPCs/King Grol\|King Grol]].

![Sildar Hallwinter held at Cragmaw Hideout.webp|Sildar Hallwinter held at Cragmaw Hideout](/img/user/Assets/Sildar%20Hallwinter%20held%20at%20Cragmaw%20Hideout.webp)

He warned them about a [[NPCs/Unidentified goblins with elongated skulls and glowing green weapons\|strange goblin]] who whispered unsettling words ("You are not the one [[NPCs/Rusithed\|Rusithed]] wants.") to him, hinting at a deeper, darker plot. [[NPCs/Sildar Hallwinter\|Sildar]] suggested someone in [[Locations/Esson\|Esson]] might know the location of [[Locations/Cragmaw Castle\|Cragmaw Castle]]. He armed himself with a goblin blade and left, urging the party to clear the caves and confront [[NPCs/Klarg\|Klarg]] before meeting him in [[Locations/Esson\|Esson]]. With their resolve steeled, the [[Fellowships/Ember Knights\|Ember Knights]] prepared for the next phase of their perilous journey.
