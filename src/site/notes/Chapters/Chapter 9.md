# The Secret of Coneberry

The party approached the base of Old Owl Well, ascending the hill cautiously, their eyes scanning the dilapidated ruins of the outpost. Within the crumbling remains, they stumbled upon a tent and the outpost filled with motionless zombies. Though the party tried to attract the undead, they remained unresponsive—until the group ventured inside. In a flash, the zombies attacked, launching the party into a fierce battle. The air crackled with the clash of swords and the flare of magic. Amidst the chaos, Azvameth took a devastating hit and collapsed.

Just as hope seemed to wane, a bald, tattooed man emerged from the tent, commanding the zombies to stand down. He introduced himself as Hamun Kost, a Red Wizard of Thay, and explained the zombies were his servants, guarding the ruins. When questioned about his presence, he revealed he was searching for the identity of the outpost's builders. He told them of a mysterious banshee who could answer any question in exchange for a silver object.

Luard was gravely injured but was saved by his companions, who triumphed over the beast. Among the remains, they discovered a skeleton with a diary belonging to someone named R.K., who mentioned a broken mirror around the village in an entry written 12 years ago.

Confused but determined, the party continued until they reached a strange collection of mirrors, each standing atop tall posts and forming a circular fence. Upon realizing one of the mirrors was broken, they deduced it to be the one mentioned in the diary. Stepping through the threshold of mirrors, a strange sensation washed over them, and suddenly, all but Luard seemed to forget who they were....
