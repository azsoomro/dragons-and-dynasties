# The Terror Below

After crossing the mysterious mirror fence, the party entered the village, only to be greeted by a strange melodious song. Most of the group suddenly lost their memories, forgetting who they were and why they had come, but Luard managed to resist. As they moved deeper into the village, the forgetful members saw a lively and beautiful settlement, while Luard perceived the grim reality of an old, decayed, and abandoned place.

They encountered a peculiar bard named Killian, who seemed to think he belonged in the village. However, soon the song’s effects reversed; Luard forgot, while Azvameth, Zyluxias, and Tor regained their memories. The group questioned Killian about his past, but the bard had no recollection. They convinced him to join them, hoping to uncover more answers.

Investigating the village, they were led to the graveyard. There, they discovered an illusion masking a hidden entrance. Venturing beneath the village, they found themselves in a decrepit cavern, where a harpy sat singing. When they confronted the harpy, it attacked—but soon they realized it was a pseudopod of a much greater danger: an Elder Oblex.

The Oblex descended upon them in a fierce battle, and both Azvameth and Zyluxias fell to its attacks. But the bard’s soothing words revived them, and Zyluxias, gathering his strength, struck the killing blow.

With the Oblex defeated, the party uncovered the village’s dark secret: the creature had been holding the villagers hostage, using them as a human farm to feed on their memories. The village elder, now free from the Oblex’s grasp, rewarded the party and offered them food and shelter. In the aftermath, the party discovered Killian carried a ring similar to theirs.

While the group rested, Zyluxias was haunted by Scale Reaver, his powerful weapon. Succumbing to its influence, he underwent another transformation, becoming more draconic and feral in appearance—though his sanity held on, for now. As night fell, Leon quietly slipped away, vanishing into the darkness without a trace.
