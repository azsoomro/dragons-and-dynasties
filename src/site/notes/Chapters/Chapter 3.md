# Trouble in Esson

After arriving in the bustling town of [[Locations/Esson\|Esson]], our intrepid adventurers concluded their business and made their way to the [[Locations/Stonehill Inn\|Stonehill Inn]] for a well-deserved rest. While gathered around a table, they noticed a curious coincidence: each of them carried a ring that looked remarkably similar. Though they didn't dwell on it, the strange discovery added a touch of mystery to their evening.

As the night deepened, they gathered information from the inn's patrons before retiring to their rooms. [[Characters/Torebrul “Tor” Drakechest\|Tor]], the party's cleric, experienced a vivid vision of [[NPCs/Selûne\|Selûne]], the goddess of the moon, offering him guidance. This divine encounter left him with a sense of purpose and clarity.

In the morning, they met [[NPCs/Sildar Hallwinter\|Sildar Hallwinter]], who thanked them for saving his life and requested the party to help him find his Wizard friend [[NPCs/Iarno Albrek\|Iarno]] who had gone mssing two months ago near Trascendor Manor. He also wanted to lead them to a meeting with [[Harbin Wester\|Harbin Wester]], the town's mayor. But before heading to their appointment, curiosity got the better of them, and they decided to investigate the [[Locations/Shrine of Luck\|Shrine of Luck]]. There, they broke into [[NPCs/Sister Garele\|Sister Garele]]'s chapel and uncovered cryptic notes about a wizard's spellbook, a banshee, and the village of [[Conyberry\|Conyberry]]. They also found a cat.

Satisfied with their findings, they proceeded to meet [[NPCs/Sildar Hallwinter\|Sildar]], who commended them for eliminating the goblin threat south of [[Locations/Esson\|Esson]] and rewarded them for their bravery. During this meeting, they also encountered [[NPCs/Allura Vilerial\|Allura Vilerial]], a mysterious figure who acted strangely toward them but offered no explanation.

[[Harbin Wester\|Harbin Wester]] then requested the party to clear the roads north of the town of goblins and to urgently search for [[NPCs/Gundren Rockseeker\|Gundren Rockseeker]] to ensure his safe return. The party accepted these tasks and set off on their mission.

Before leaving, they spotted [[NPCs/Allura Vilerial\|Allura]] on the cusp of entering her tower with her maid, escorting a visibly injured [[NPCs/Sister Garele\|Sister Garele]]. When the party requested a meeting, [[NPCs/Allura Vilerial\|Allura]], clearly preoccupied, asked them to return later and sent them away.

Undeterred, they visited [[Quelline Alderleaf\|Quelline Alderleaf]] and [[NPCs/Daran Edermath\|Daran Edermath]]. From [[Quelline Alderleaf\|Quelline]], they learned how to find the location of [[Locations/Cragmaw Castle\|Cragmaw Castle]], and from [[NPCs/Daran Edermath\|Daran]], they gathered information about the [[Fellowships/Red Brands\|Red Brands]], their leader [[Silverstaff\|Silverstaff]] and their hideout, a notorious bandit group plaguing the town.

Now, armed with new knowledge and a renewed sense of purpose, the party prepares to face the challenges that lie ahead.
