# The Beach Episode

His form twisted, muscles contorting, skin hardening to scales, until he took the terrible shape of a dragon. Without a word or glance back, Zyluxias let out a roar that echoed through the lands before disappearing into the skies—a tragic loss as he flew into the unknown.

But their despair was cut short by a new presence: from a dark portal stepped a red-skinned tiefling, his sinister grin framed by two deadly succubi flanking his sides. The tiefling introduced himself as Sinclaw, an agent sent by none other than Asmodeus himself. With an air of twisted charm, Sinclaw claimed he was here to help them recover Zyluxias—one way or another. Should they fail to bring their friend back, Asmodeus would accept no loose ends.

Trust uneasy, but options few, the party took their chances with Sinclaw, following him across realms to track down Zyluxias. But something went awry; in a shimmer of distortion, half the party found themselves cast adrift in the astral sea, landing near a grim and floating mausoleum. The air was thick with a haunting silence, broken only by the faint whisper of lost souls.

Venturing inside, they discovered a tomb—a crypt of a lich bound to dark symbols of Vecna, the god of secrets and decay. Shadows grew long as they faced off against spectral guardians and the undead protector of the tomb. Through sheer resolve, they battled their way through, emerging scarred but victorious, and in possession of a strange weapon and an ominous phylactery etched with Vecna’s symbols.

Then, like a dark omen, Sinclaw reappeared, gathering them with little more than a wave of his hand, pulling them back into the correct path. Now, their journey resumes, shadowed by the knowledge that if they find Zyluxias, their next decision will be one of impossible stakes: to save their friend—or to destroy him.
