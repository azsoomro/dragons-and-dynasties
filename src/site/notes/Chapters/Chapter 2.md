# Arrival at Esson

With the brutal dispatch of [[NPCs/Yeemik\|Yeemik]] fresh in their minds, the [[Fellowships/Ember Knights\|Ember Knights]]—[[Characters/Bughuda “Huda” Qasai\|Huda]], [[Characters/Leon Greyhawk\|Leon]], [[Characters/Luard Starwalker\|Luard]], [[Characters/Moghul Khan\|Moghul]], [[Characters/Torebrul “Tor” Drakechest\|Tor]], and [[Characters/Zyluxias Relmaur\|Zyluxias]]—tended to their wounds before pressing deeper into the dark, winding caverns in search of [[NPCs/Klarg\|Klarg]], the bugbear leader of the goblins. As they navigated the maze-like tunnels, they encountered more goblins, swiftly dispatching them with a mix of steel and sorcery.

Their journey brought them to [[NPCs/Klarg\|Klarg]]'s lair, a foreboding chamber echoing with the bugbear’s growls. [[Characters/Leon Greyhawk\|Leon]], ever the diplomat, moved to speak, but [[Characters/Zyluxias Relmaur\|Zyluxias]], seething with rage, advanced with deadly intent. [[NPCs/Klarg\|Klarg]], momentarily puzzled by the intrusion, demanded to know why they had invaded his domain. Before any parley could occur, [[Characters/Luard Starwalker\|Luard]] unleashed a bolt of fire, shattering any chance of negotiation. The room erupted into chaos as [[NPCs/Klarg\|Klarg]], incensed by the attack, launched himself at the party.

The battle was fierce and unforgiving, but the [[Fellowships/Ember Knights\|Ember Knights]], united in purpose, emerged victorious, felling [[NPCs/Klarg\|Klarg]] with a final, decisive blow. With their enemy vanquished, they turned to a cowering goblin, coercing him into servitude and naming him [[NPCs/Pickles\|Pickles]]. A search of the lair revealed stolen provisions from the [[Locations/Lionshield Coaster\|Lionshield Coaster]], which they reclaimed. Rejoining [[NPCs/Sildar Hallwinter\|Sildar]], who awaited their return, they made their way to [[Locations/Esson\|Esson]].

Upon arrival, [[NPCs/Sildar Hallwinter\|Sildar]] retired to the [[Locations/Stonehill Inn\|Stonehill Inn]], requesting a meeting the following morning. The party proceeded to [[Locations/Barthen's Provisions\|Barthen's Provisions]], where they delivered their cargo and received their reward. Their next stop was the [[Locations/Lionshield Coaster\|Lionshield Coaster]], where the grateful proprietor, [[NPCs/Linene Greywind\|Linene Greywind]], compensated them for the recovered goods.

Their quest led them to the [[Locations/Shrine of Luck\|Shrine of Luck]], only to find [[NPCs/Sister Garele\|Sister Garele]] away on business. After offering prayers, they visited the [[Locations/Invulnerable Vagrant\|Invulnerable Vagrant]], where they met the enigmatic [[NPCs/Kermit Prime\|Kermit Sol]] and procured magical items to aid in their journey. With their business concluded, the [[Fellowships/Ember Knights\|Ember Knights]] returned to the [[Locations/Stonehill Inn\|Stonehill Inn]], their minds buzzing with the day’s triumphs and the promise of adventures yet to come.
