# The Black Spider At Last

Deep within the twisting tunnels of the mine, the party pressed onward, only to face the strange and deadly creatures lurking in the shadows. A group of slime-like monstrosities emerged, their amorphous forms proving a dangerous challenge. As they pushed forward, they were met with a formidable block of jelly and two enormous snakes, whose presence hinted at something unnatural within these depths.

Deeper still, the mine revealed a more sinister threat—a band of bugbears led by none other than Iarno “Silverstaff,” the traitorous wizard. As the bugbears attacked, Iarno fled, forcing the party to pursue him through the winding passages.

The chase led them to a dark and foreboding chamber—the lair of the Spider. There, in the flickering shadows, the party discovered Iarno holding Nundro hostage, his fate precariously tied to their next move.

What schemes does Silverstaff plot, and what dangers lie ahead in the Spider's web? The answers wait in the depths, but time is running out.
