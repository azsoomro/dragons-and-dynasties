# The Missing Wizard & The Spider

After meeting with Daran and Quelinne, the adventurers made their way to the bustling bazaar. They spent some time buying bits and bobs, knick-knacks, and odds and ends. Amidst the chaos, Leon noticed Bughuda slipping away into the crowd. He tried to follow her but lost track of her in the sea of people. Returning to the group, he informed them of her disappearance. Determined to find answers, they decided to visit the Esson Miner's Exchange next.

On their way, they were ambushed by a group of Redbrand Ruffians. The ruffians intimidated them, accusing them of asking too many questions about the Redbrands. They threatened to take their belongings and force them out of town. A fierce fight broke out. The party killed two of the five men and captured the remaining three. Under interrogation, the ruffians revealed their base under the decrepit mansion on the hill, led by a human wizard known as SilverStaff. They also mentioned a nothic guarding the complex and reinforcements of bugbears sent by someone called the Spider.

Determined to infiltrate the Redbrand Hideout, the party donned their caps and sneaked in. Navigating through a complex of rooms and caves, they managed to free Marina Dendar and her children. In the private quarters of SilverStaff, they discovered his true identity: Iarno Albrek, working with the Spider. They found a secret hidden room beneath the complex and a diary of a dwarven adventurer detailing the Wave Echo Caves, the Forge of Souls, and the Essex Pact. The diary ended abruptly with a cryptic line about "The Ember Sovereign."

Reaching the center of the complex, they battled the nothic and made their way to the secret room. There, they found Iarno Albrek along with several members of the Spider Cult and a drow holding a glaive. They learned the name of this Champion of the Spider Cult: Xelara. Xelara ordered Albrek and the cultists to take what they found and leave. He advised the party to do the same. Ready for a fight, the adventurers prepared themselves. But Xelara proved too powerful, swiftly knocking each of them out. As darkness took them, he left them with cryptic statements, leaving them with more questions than answers as they drifted into unconsciousness.
