# Lost Mine of Esson

The party returned to Esson as twilight blanketed the town, their hearts heavy yet relieved after successfully rescuing Gundren Rockseeker from peril. Though weary, Gundren urged them to rest and meet him at Harbin's Keep the next morning to strategize their approach to reclaiming the fabled mine.

At the Stonehill Inn, the group found brief respite but no shortage of intrigue. Strategies were whispered over warm ales. Luard delved into faith with Tor, unraveling the mystique of Selûne’s clergy and the pursuit of divine light. Huda practiced the ancient tongue of dragons, while Mogul channeled his creativity into crafting a small statue of King Grol, his steady hands forging art from molten copper. Amid quiet devotion, Tor wove another rosary, a tangible symbol of his piety.

The dawn brought purpose as the adventurers resupplied at the bustling bazaar, restocking for the challenges ahead. At the Venatores guild, Jack Mihoff welcomed Huda with a reward for her recent exploits, along with a peculiar gift—a freezer bag to preserve the volatile components of harvested creatures.

Reuniting with Huda’s brother, Sten, the party found him recovering but scarred, both in body and spirit. His injuries told a story of courage, but his teasing and camaraderie betrayed an unbroken resolve. Amid his playful banter, revelations surfaced—fragments of family lore, whispers of their father’s mysterious past as "Grognar the Adventurer." While Sten dismissed the tales with jest, the seeds of doubt and curiosity were planted.

Later, at Harbin's Keep, the council room buzzed with anticipation. Familiar faces—Harbin Wester, Sildar Hallwinter, Gundren, and others—welcomed the group. Congratulations and rewards flowed freely, but the weight of the task ahead loomed large. Gundren's plea was simple but dire: accompany him to the mine, cleanse it of lurking monstrosities, and secure it from the clutches of a dark force known only as the Spider.

Discussions turned to the enigmatic Xelara, a name steeped in legend. Tor recounted their unsettling encounter with someone bearing her name, an ally of the Arachna. Was this a hero turned traitor, or an imposter cloaked in shadow? The room bristled with tension, promises of investigation exchanged.

As the meeting concluded, plans solidified. Harbin revealed his quandary: the mine’s potential as both a treasure and a curse. It could elevate Esson’s prominence or entangle it in the web of power struggles among greater forces. Meanwhile, Durin and Rala extended heartfelt blessings, inviting Tor and Mogul to Estadul to continue their sacred journey.

With determination, the party ventured into the depths of the mine, leaving Gundren, Sildar, and the guards at its entrance. Within the shadowy caverns, the grim truth awaited. The body of Tharden Rockseeker, Gundren’s brother, was found lifeless—his sacrifice honored with a solemn burial. Yet the mysteries did not end there. Further exploration revealed the corpse of a strange goblin, its elongated head and pale markings defying natural explanation.

“What manner of creature is this?” the question echoed through the oppressive darkness.

The answers lie deeper within the mine, where danger and revelation await.
