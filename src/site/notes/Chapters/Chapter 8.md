# RIP Pickles 2024

The party awoke from their slumber and spent the morning exchanging stories. Tor spoke with Leon, learning more about his background, while Tor also questioned Luard about the picture he had been holding while asleep. Luard revealed that the woman in the photo was Luna, his senior from the academy, and the other was his mentor.

As the conversation shifted to Xelara, Leon suggested that defeating the elusive drow would be a good idea, but Pickles snickered, doubting the party’s ability to take him down. Undeterred, the group continued on their journey, coming to a fork in the road and choosing to pass by Old Owl Well, heading toward Wyvern's Tor. There, they encountered remnants of the Redbrand bandits, engaging in a fierce battle that ended in the party’s victory.

In the cave, they found strange paintings of goblins, but it was Pickles' snickering that caught their attention. He showed them his repaired crossbow, eager to prove himself useful in future battles. However, when Azvameth tried to pat him on the head, he snapped, threatening her if she touched him again as shes not his master. Zyluxsious, offended by Pickles' attitude, attempted to attack and easily overpowered Pickles killing him and crushing his skull in a brutal display.

Mogul, disturbed by Zyluxsious' behavior, expressed his unease, while Azvameth later tried to explain their ways and complimented Mogul on his battle prowess. Meanwhile, Tor and Luard buried Pickles' remains in the cave. After a somber rest, the party continued their journey, eventually arriving at Old Owl Well. Now, standing at the base of the hill, they contemplate their next move.
