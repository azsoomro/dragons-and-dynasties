# Zyluxias The Ember Soverign?

The party arrived at the base of a smoldering volcano, watching as the dark silhouette of a dragon vanished into the fiery depths above. Determined to save their friend, they steeled themselves for the journey, ready to face whatever had taken hold of Zyluxias. Along the way, they encountered a hulking goliath named Dum Bass, whose good-hearted spirit led him to join their cause.

Upon reaching Zyluxias’s lair, they approached with both hope and caution, calling out to the friend they knew might still be somewhere within. But no words could break through the curse’s hold, and in an instant, the lair erupted into chaos. Their friend—now a fierce dragon—lunged, forcing the party to fight back, wrestling with both their foe and their loyalty to Zyluxias.

In the thick of battle, Huda and Dum Bass held the dragon as best they could, each blow and claw a struggle for control. But tragedy struck as Tor, steadfast and brave, was dealt a fatal wound, crumpling to the ground before Mogul’s horrified eyes. Fury overtook Mogul as he gripped his stone-cursed blade, its dark magic feeding his vengeful spirit. With newfound strength, he joined his allies in a last, desperate assault, each member of the party giving their all to break the curse’s hold.

Their combined force finally brought the dragon down. In a moment of eerie silence, Zyluxias’s draconic form faded away, leaving only their friend as they had first met him, unscathed and familiar.

Carrying Zyluxias, they returned to Thundertree and attempted to revive him, yet every spell and bit of magic failed to stir him. But then, from the stillness, the spirit of the druid Sylphyra reached out to Tor, guiding him in a ritual to break the curse’s final chains. Each member of the party offered a deeply cherished item, a piece of their soul, to rekindle the light within their friend.

With these offerings of love and sacrifice, the curse shattered, and Zyluxias’s eyes slowly opened, restored and free once more.
