# The Druid, The Dragon & The Warlock

The wind howled through the desolate, blighted ruins of Thundertree as the party stood victorious, having just defeated the twisted plant monsters that had beset them. Exhausted but not broken, they took a moment to catch their breath. But before the dust could settle, the ground trembled as a familiar figure descended from the sky. Zyluxias had returned.

His arrival was sudden, and though the party questioned where their companion had been, Zyluxias brushed it off with a casual shrug, offering no explanation. The tension of uncertainty briefly lingered in the air, but the joy of his return quickly washed it away. With renewed strength and spirits high, the party pressed deeper into the ominous ruins.

Venturing into a nearby building, their optimism was quickly shattered. Zombies, caked in ash and soot, shambled forth from the shadows, flanked by a sinister, shadowy entity. The battle was fierce. Swords clashed against rotting flesh, and spells crackled through the air. But then, Tor—mighty in faith—called upon his deity, summoning a radiant light that turned the undead away. The zombies, gripped by divine fear, fled the building, and the party gave chase, cutting them down as they emerged into the open.

Just then a desperate scream tore through the air. Huda, called for Zyluxias. In a display of immense strength and power, Zyluxias hurled himself through the crumbling walls, sending debris scattering as the structure collapsed completely. The party stood in awe, but their moment of reprieve was short-lived.

While investigating the ruins, Mogul noticed another dilapidated building nearby. With a playful tone, he called for Zyluxias to demolish this one as well. But Zyluxias, eager to explore further, instead took a path leading south. However, his confidence faltered as he stumbled into a massive web, trapping him in place. As the party continued their investigation, Zyluxias’ struggles attracted the attention of three enormous spiders lurking in the shadows. Their eyes gleamed with hunger as they descended upon their prey.

The fight was immediate and intense. The spiders, swift and deadly, surrounded Zyluxias, eager to sink their fangs into him. But the rest of the party was not far behind. Rushing to his aid, they struck down the arachnids with precision and fury, swiftly dispatching the threat. As the battle ended, the group cautioned Zyluxias, urging him to be more careful.

Wiping the sweat from their brows, the group’s attention shifted to a new sight—a well-built and heavily fortified house standing defiantly against the decay around it. Intrigued, the party debated their next move. As they pondered, the conversation turned lighthearted—perhaps too lighthearted—as the topic of Luard’s manhood was raised. With a boastful grin, Luard began to brag about his ‘unique gifts,’ but just as his voice reached its peak, something strange occurred.

A floating eyeball appeared above Luard’s head, observing him for a moment. And then—agony. A sharp, searing pain shot through his body, sending him crumpling to his knees as he clutched his crotch in anguish, screaming, "She’s near! She’s near!" The party, both confused and concerned, helped Luard to his feet, assuring him that no one was there. Yet the ominous warning still hung in the air.

Determined to find answers, the party approached the fortified house and knocked on the door. A moment later, it opened to reveal a woman who introduced herself as Riedoth, a druid. Relief washed over the group as she welcomed them inside. Zyluxias, with his towering frame, barely fit through the entrance, but with some effort, they all managed to gather in the druid’s modest home.

Once inside, the party wasted no time, explaining their urgent need to find Gundren Rockseeker and the location of Cragmaw Castle. They also shared their concerns about the growing threats from goblins and bugbears. Riedoth listened carefully, nodding as they spoke, but her expression grew grim. She warned them that if they simply killed the goblin leader or drove the creatures from their stronghold, the displaced goblins would likely wreak havoc on the surrounding forest, slaughtering creatures indiscriminately.

She offered the party a deal: defeat a dangerous plant monster that had taken root nearby, and she would help guide the goblins to settle in the now-cleansed ruins of Thundertree, creating their own village and sparing the forest from further harm. She added that if they helped, Tor's goddess, would surely be pleased, for the wildfire cudgel he bore was none other than the prison of Sylphyra herself who was favoured by his goddess Selune.

The party fell silent, contemplating the decision before them. But before they could act, the conversation was violently interrupted. Scale Reaver, Zyluxias’ ancient weapon, growing restless and frustrated with the prattle, seized control of Zyluxias. In a horrifying display, the blade forced Zyluxias’ arm to stab himself through the chest. The group could only watch in shock as Zyluxias fell back, crashing through the druid’s dwelling and collapsing the wall.

Crawling into the open air, Zyluxias’ form began to shift and grow. His body expanded, muscles bulging, and scales erupted across his skin. His once humanoid form twisted into that of a full-sized red dragon. The ground shook as his massive wings unfurled, casting a dark shadow over the party. With a deafening roar, Zyluxias turned, his eyes briefly locking onto the group, before taking to the skies and flying toward the distant mountains.

The party stood in stunned silence, still grappling with what they had just witnessed, when suddenly, a portal opened before them. From its swirling depths, a red-skinned tiefling emerged, flanked by two succubi. He introduced himself as Sinclaw, and in a tone both curious and amused, asked whether this was the place his master, Asmodeus, had sent him. One of his succubus assured him that this was indeed the place phropisized by the Tower of Heaven

Sinclaw explained that he had been tasked with either saving Zyluxias or killing him—whatever the situation demanded. His mission was clear, and he intended to see it through with or without their help. The party, knowing their friend’s life hung in the balance, agreed to join forces with Sinclaw.

One of the succubi opened another portal, and together, they stepped through it, arriving in a mountainous region. In the distance, they saw a towering volcano, its summit glowing with fiery light. As they took in their surroundings, the sound of soft sobbing caught their attention. Following the sound, they found a goliath, curled up behind a boulder, tears streaming down his face.

Before they could inquire further, a familiar roar echoed from the skies. They looked up in time to see the red dragon—Zyluxias—soaring towards the volcano, vanishing into the molten depths as the earth trembled once more.
