# Arrival at Thundertree Ruins

After waking from a restless night, the party gathered to discuss Tor’s troubling dream, seeking guidance on the path ahead. The village elder soon arrived, presenting them with a strange, old bent fork—an artifact from a time long past. Deciding this mysterious object might be the key, the party set out to consult the enigmatic Banshee.

Before them, the Banshee’s domain loomed, shrouded in riddles. With their wits sharp, they solved her entrance puzzle and gained her audience. Tor approached first, offering the silver fork in tribute. In return, he asked of the ancient Old Owl Well and received the knowledge he sought.

Next, Azvameth stepped forward, gifting the Banshee a pendant. His query: the whereabouts of the fabled Bowgentle’s spellbook. The Banshee, true to her word, bestowed the answer in exchange for the pendant. Azvameth decided to head back to Allura as she was only accompanying the party for this part of their journey.

Their dealings with the spectral being complete, the party ventured toward the ruins of Thundertree. But danger met them at the threshold—small, vicious plant creatures attacked without warning. Battle-hardened and swift, the party dispatched their foes with ease.

But just as victory seemed certain, a strange, all-encompassing darkness descended upon them… and the heroes, mighty though they were, suddenly blacked out—as if the very power that fuels their world had... well, gone out.

(And so, with the mysterious forces beyond even their control, their adventure was paused—awaiting the return of the light....)
