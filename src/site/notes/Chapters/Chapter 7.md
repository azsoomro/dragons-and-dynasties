# The Raging Siblings

As the party exited Allura’s tower, Mithxa shared tales of Xelara’s legendary feats during the Sundering War, casting a shadow of intrigue over their journey. Outside, they were met by Huda’s brother, Sten, who handed her a job form from the Venatores. Eager to prove herself, Huda asked Sten to accompany her on her first hunt, and he agreed.

Seeking their rewards, the group mistakenly went to Harbin’s Keep instead of their intended destination. There, they discovered a convoy of delegates from Estadul meeting with Sovereign Wester. Their attempt to gain a forced audience was swiftly blocked by vigilant guards.

Leaving the keep, they wandered into a curious bookshop called "Chastity’s Nook," an establishment filled with adult smut, run by the eccentric Iva. Amidst the risqué literature, Tor learned names of some individuals, deepening the mystery around them.

The party then set out towards their quarry north of Esson. As night fell, they made camp, exchanging quiet words under the stars. During her solitary watch, Huda was tormented by recent changes in her body—her skin turning reddish, and a sharp pain in her chest. Investigating, she found her once-mundane ring had changed color, signaling something ominous.

Her distraction proved costly, as the camp was suddenly besieged by wild owlbears. The party fought fiercely, dispatching the beasts with swift, brutal efficiency. But as they settled back into an uneasy sleep, Tor’s curiosity led him to study a picture Luard held in his hand, revealing glimpses of a past he had kept hidden. The picture revealed a young Luard, his friend and senior Luna and his mentor, Dammaron back from his days at the Neverwinter Academy.

The night was filled with unease, as they each wondered what dark secrets and challenges awaited them in the days ahead.
