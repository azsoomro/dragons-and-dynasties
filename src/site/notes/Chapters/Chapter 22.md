# The Fall of the Spider

The confrontation with The Spider began as a battle of words and deception. He revealed his mission: to claim the Forge of Souls in the name of The Arachna. Tor lied, saying the party sought only to rescue Nundro, while The Spider lied in return, agreeing to release their friend if they left him in peace. Both sides knew the truth—the lies would lead to bloodshed.

Nundro, released and running to safety, revealed his true form as a doppelgänger, attacking the party from behind. Chaos erupted. The Spider’s fireball scorched the battlefield, leaving Tor unconscious, while his bugbear allies shed their disguises, revealing an ettin and a flesh golem.

Huda’s quick thinking and the Happy Helper revived Tor, who unleashed the power of his wildfire cudgel, cloaking the battlefield in darkness and ash. This turned the tide, allowing the party to strike down the ettin and the flesh golem. The Spider succumbed to the ashen magic, but with his dying breath, he summoned two driders to finish the fight.

The driders pressed the party to their limits, nearly killing Huda. But through grit, teamwork, and quick strategy, the adventurers brought the monstrosities down. As they paused to catch their breath, Mogul, ever curious, pried gems from a statue of Dumation, triggering a deadly trap.

The ceiling collapsed, burying the chamber in rubble. Tor and Huda, already gravely injured, were knocked unconscious once more. The remaining party members scrambled to pull them from the debris, applying healing magic just in time to save their lives.

In the aftermath, they found the real Nundro locked in a nearby room. Grateful for his rescue, he provided a map of the mine and guided them to a safe room before departing. Now, battered but alive, the party prepares to decide their next move in the treacherous depths of the mine.
