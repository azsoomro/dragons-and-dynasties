# Rockseeker Retrieved

Pressing deeper into the treacherous halls of Cragmaw Castle, the party carved their way through waves of enemies, battling fiercely with each encounter. But the journey was not without its peril—both Luard and Zyluxias fell in the heat of combat. In a moment of desperate resolve, Tor called upon the divine grace of Selûne, channeling her light to heal their grievous wounds and bring them back to the fight. Meanwhile, Huda skillfully harvested valuable Grick body parts, ever resourceful even amidst danger.

Eventually, the party reached the chamber of King Grol. There, they found their missing friend, Gundren Rockseeker, unconscious on the floor, with the towering bugbear king and his ferocious pet wolf standing guard. When confronted, King Grol demanded an explanation for the intrusion. The party revealed their mission: to rescue their friend and uncover the truth behind his abduction.

King Grol, to their surprise, confessed readily. He had been paid a mere 200 gold by a mysterious drow to kidnap Gundren. The revelation infuriated the party—not only for the small sum but for the devastation it threatened to bring. Grol defended his actions, explaining that he sought to unite the goblinoid tribes under the Cragmaw banner to establish a peaceful home, free from the constant oppression of human civilizations. Left with no other means, he had resorted to such work to fund his vision.

Moved by his cause, the party struck a deal: they would pay the 200 gold in exchange for Gundren’s freedom. But just as it seemed the matter was resolved, Gundren stirred—only to lunge at Tor, stabbing him! The dwarf revealed himself as a doppelganger in disguise. Chaos erupted as battle commenced. In the end, the party triumphed, subduing King Grol and slaying the treacherous doppelganger.

Searching further, they discovered the real Gundren Rockseeker, bound and hidden in a separate room. After freeing him, they healed King Grol and offered him an alternative—sanctuary in Reidoth’s village in Thundertree. Skeptical at first, Grol accepted after verifying their sincerity, handing over Gundren’s precious map case before departing with his kin to start anew.

On the road back to Esson, Gundren shared the secrets of the Lost Mine of Esson, the Essex Pact, and the legendary Forge of Spells. With concern for his brothers and determination to reclaim the mine, Gundren offered the party a partnership: help him restore the mine, and they would receive 10% of its income as their share. The deal struck, the party set their sights on Esson, ready to face the challenges ahead.

What secrets await in the Lost Mine? And what dangers still lurk in the shadows of their path? Their journey is far from over.
